			<p>My name is Chris Fergo and I live on Long Island. I'm 21  years old and a recent Video Game Design graduate!  I‘ve been interested in 3D modeling and  animation for quite some time now.<br />
			  </p>
			<p>I was an avid Star Wars fan growing up and I was heavily active  at <a href="http://www.theforce.net/">www.theforce.net</a>.  Then in 1999 they  made a new section to the site that included Fan-Films.  I became intrigued.  Some of the fan-made films on the site are  pretty amazing for amateur filmmakers. I was blown away by a lot of them, so I  became inspired to make one myself. Long story short, I had a lot of failed  attempts for a film, but I did have a lot of FX tests.  I used makeshift blue screens and green  screens.  I learned how to create  lightsaber glows in Photoshop (the very thing Photoshop was designed for).  But one thing I could not tackle was 3D  modeling.  I tried so hard to learn on my  own.  I bought books, tried to follow  tutorials, fooled around with the programs but nothing was sinking in. I knew  that if I was ever going to learn 3D I was going to have to go to school for  it.<br />
		  </p>
		  <p>In April 2006, I finally found a great school where I could  learn 3D modeling and animation. It was in a Game and Web design course.  I didn’t mind at all, I’ve always been a pretty  big gamer myself.  Two of the most  amazing games I’ve ever played are Mortal Kombat and Half-Life. While I was  there I met a lot of wonderful people, two I definitely have to mention are Frankie and  Mr. Mastermaker. Frankie stood by me and helps me out all the time, and I thank  him for that.  He always tells me to ‘Stay  on the information highway, there’s no need to take side roads.’ Mr.  Mastermaker, I’m proud to say, was the teacher who not only taught me 3D modeling  and animation, but made it stick. Both of these guys inspire me and are the  reason why I spend so much time getting my models to look just right.<br />

			<p>On the side I also draw and play music. I have been playing  the drums for over 10 years and guitar for 5 years. I competed in NYSSMA and got  involved with school and local bands, performing Classical, Rock and Heavy  Metal.</p>
